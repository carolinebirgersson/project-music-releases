# Music Releases
The brief was to create a site with music releases catched from data – and learn how to use React. This was a pair programming project and I worked with https://github.com/jonnaru

We learned:
– What problems React solves.
– What a boilerplate project is, and how to run the technigo react starter project.
– How to break up JavaScript code into importable modules. 
– How to write JSX.

## The problem

We used React and divided the site into components and made a css-file to every component which was a new approach to a project. In this case, when the site is so shallow, we could have used one css-file but it was a good practise to style each of the components separate. We made it accessible and responsive.
